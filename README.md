# Takaful

Islamic insurance Referred to as "Takaful" which means solidarity in the Arabic language, Takaful insurance is a model of Islamic insurance based on the principles of mutual assistance, mutual aid, and voluntary contribution. This model involves the separation of funds from shareholders and policyholders, the distribution of technical profits to policyholders, compliance of assets with Sharia law as well as certification by a Sharia council. The operating models differ depending on how the technical benefits are distributed between the insurer and its policyholders.
